# BLEU
# Focus: Precision
# Measures: “How much of what the model wrote matches the reference?”
# Think: “Did the model use the same words/phrases as the reference?”
# Example: Model repeats most words from the original → high BLEU

# ROUGE
# Focus: Recall
# Measures: “How much of the reference is covered by the model’s output?”
# Think: “Did the model include the important content from the reference?”
# Example: Model captures all key ideas, even with different wording → high ROUGE
